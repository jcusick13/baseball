# Fair Weather Fans

Analysis of data from the 2016 MLB season to determine which teams have the most fair weather fans. This will look to implement some of the suggestions made by Glass<sup>1</sup> including studying trends over timespans shorter than a single season and incorporating measures of superstar players on visiting teams.

All star rosters were downloaded from [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/allstar/2016-allstar-game.shtml) for the 2015 and 2016 games and then saved as csv files.
